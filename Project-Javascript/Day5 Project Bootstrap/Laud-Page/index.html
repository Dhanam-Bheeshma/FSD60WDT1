        <h2>Awesome Writer</h2>
        <p>The political conditions in which Nazrul Islam eventually began his career as a writer was one conditioned by extreme tensions and conflict including the Jallianwala Bagh massacre and launch of the Non-Cooperation Movement following the special session of the Indian National Congress, and especially in the context of the “divide and rule” policy which was adopted by the British.Kazi Nazrul Islam published his first book, which was a collection of poetical prose written in the form of stories in 1922. Apart from writing and working for several other newspapers of the times, including Sevak, he had started his own political weekly in 1922, named, Dhumketu. The political weekly received much appreciation and readership from the educated middle-class section went on to become a hallmark of Kazi Nazrul Islam’s politico-literary. As a result, significant tensions were generated between him and the government.
